	abstract = {Nonmethane hydrocarbons are ubiquitous trace atmospheric constituents yet they control the oxidation capacity of the atmosphere. Both anthropogenic and biogenic processes contribute to the release of hydrocarbons to the atmosphere. In this manuscript, the state of the science concerning biosynthesis, transport, and chemical transformation of hydrocarbons emitted by the terrestrial biosphere is reviewed. In particular, the focus is on isoprene, monoterpenes, and oxygenated hydrocarbons. The generated science during the last 10 years is reviewed to explain and quantify hydrocarbon emissions from vegetation and to discern impacts of biogenic hydrocarbons on local and regional atmospheric chemistry. Furthermore, the physiological and environmental processes controlling biosynthesis and production of hydrocarbon compounds are reported on. Many advances have been made on measurement and modeling approaches developed to quantify hydrocarbon emissions from leaves and forest ecosystems. A synthesis of the atmospheric chemistry of biogenic hydrocarbons and their role in the formation of oxidants and aerosols is presented. The integration of biogenic hydrocarbon kinetics and atmospheric physics into mathematical modeling systems is examined to assess the contribution of biogenic hydrocarbons to the formation of oxidants and aerosols, thereby allowing us to study their impacts on the earth's climate system and to develop strategies to reduce oxidant precursors in affected regions.},

	abstract = {This chapter provides an overview of land surface processes and climate-surface albedos, and attempts to bridge the gap between disciplinary studies of atmospheric versus surface climate. The chapter describes physical processes involving the land surface that are of concern to scientists interested in modeling the global climate system. It looks at the physics of land surface albedos by presenting a conceptual basis for understanding the basic concepts. Physical reasoning and simple mathematical models are used to summarize how these factors determine surface albedos. Some of the aspects of surface energy balance considerations that are important for global climate models are summarized. Factors that are important for determining the albedos and energy balance of land surfaces are also outlined. The mathematical theory of plant canopy albedos is presented, and a summary of parameters determining plant canopy albedo is provided. Concepts related to snow albedos, soil albedos, and surface albedos for climate models are discussed. Modeling temperature of a transpiring canopy, and modeling energy exchange over a snow surface are also described.},
